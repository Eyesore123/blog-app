## Introduction

- This is a blog app that I'm going to hook up with my portfolio site. Work in progress!

So currently it shows the posts and the comments. Admin can add new posts, edit posts and delete comments.
It still needs some work, including:

1. Spam filter (reCAPTCHA/honeypot) and rate limiter by IP address
2. Update messages
3. Error pages (404, 500 etc.)
4. RSS Feed
5. An API which is connected to portfolio site (portfolio fetches the latest blog post)
6. Installation of AI translation package (Google/DeepL)
7. Auto-translate on post save + store in DB
8. Language toggle to navbar
9. Toggle loads correct language
10. Setup SEO meta tags
11. Reply to comments (nested comments)
