# Blog App

# Made with: Laravel + React + Tailwind CSS + Inertia

## Introduction

- This is a blog app that I'm going to hook up with my portfolio site.

So currently it shows the posts and the comments. Admin can add new posts, edit posts and delete comments.
It still needs some work, including:

1. Spam filter (reCAPTCHA/honeypot) and rate limiter by IP address
2. Error pages (404, 500)
3. RSS Feed
4. An API which is connected to portfolio site (portfolio fetches the latest blog post)
5. Archives! (controller, routes etc.)
6. Installation of AI translation package (Google/DeepL)
7. Auto-translate on post save + store in DB
8. Language toggle to navbar
9. Toggle loads correct language
10. Setup SEO meta tags
